abstract = {Text passwords have been used in authentication systems for many decades. Users must recall the textual strings selected during registration to pass authentication. However, there are some serious problems with text passwords---recollection and security. Hence, various graphical-password authentication systems have been proposed to solve the problems of text passwords. Previous studies indicate that humans are better at recognizing and recalling images than texts. In 2005, Wiedenbeck et al. proposed PassPoints in which a password consists of a sequence of click-points (5 to 8) that a user chooses on an image. In the paper, we proposed an alternative system in which users can memorize fewer points while providing more security than PassPoints. Based on the idea of using an extremely large image as the password space, we propose a novel world map based graphical-password authentication system called PassMap in which a password consists of a sequence of 2 click-points that a user selects on an large world map. We also conducted a user study for evaluation. The result shows that the passwords of PassMap are easy to memorize for humans and PassMap is friendly to use in practice. Furthermore, PassMap provides higher entropy than PassPoints and also increases the cost of attacks.},

abstract = {Graphical passwords have been proposed to address known problems with traditional text passwords. For example, memorable user-chosen text passwords are predictable, but random system-assigned passwords are difficult to remember. We explore the usability effects of modifying system parameters to increase the security of a click-based graphical password system. Generally, usability tests for graphical passwords have used configurations resulting in password spaces smaller than that of common text passwords. Our two-part lab study compares the effects of varying the number of click-points and the image size, including when different configurations provide comparable password spaces. For comparable spaces, no usability advantage was evident between more click-points, or a larger image. This is contrary to our expectation that larger image size (with fewer click-points) might offer usability advantages over more click-points (with correspondingly smaller images). The results suggest promising opportunities for better matching graphical password system configurations to device constraints, or capabilities of individual users, without degrading usability. For example, more click-points could be used on smart-phone displays where larger image sizes are not possible.},

abstract = {Human-memorable passwords are a mainstay of computer security. To decrease vulnerability of passwords to brute-force dictionary attacks, many organizations enforce complicated password-creation rules and require that passwords include numerals and special characters. We demonstrate that as long as passwords remain human-memorable, they are vulnerable to "smart-dictionary" attacks even when the space of potential passwords is large.Our first insight is that the distribution of letters in easy-to-remember passwords is likely to be similar to the distribution of letters in the users' native language. Using standard Markov modeling techniques from natural language processing, this can be used to dramatically reduce the size of the password space to be searched. Our second contribution is an algorithm for efficient enumeration of the remaining password space. This allows application of time-space tradeoff techniques, limiting memory accesses to a relatively small table of "partial dictionary" sizes and enabling a very fast dictionary attack.We evaluated our method on a database of real-world user password hashes. Our algorithm successfully recovered 67.6\% of the passwords using a 2 x 109 search space. This is a much higher percentage than Oechslin's "rainbow" attack, which is the fastest currently known technique for searching large keyspaces. These results call into question viability of human-memorable character-sequence passwords as an authentication mechanism.},

ABSTRACT = {This work demonstrates the ineffectiveness of the Ripley’s K function tests, the distance to the nearest neighbor, and the empty space function in the Graphical Authentication scenario with Passpoint for the detection of non-random graphical passwords. The results obtained show that none of these tests effectively detect non-random graphical passwords; the reason for their failure is attributed to the small sample of the spatial pattern in question, where only the five points of the graphical password are analyzed. Consequently, a test based on mean distances is proposed, whose experiments show that it detects with good efficiency non-random graphical passwords in Passpoint. The test was designed to be included in the Graphical Authentication systems with Passpoint to warn the user about a possibly weak password during the registration phase, and in this way, the security of the system is increased.},

ABSTRACT = {An alternative authentication method to traditional alphanumeric passwords is graphical password authentication, also known as graphical authentication, for which one of the most valuable cued-recall techniques is PassPoints. This technique stands out for its security and usability. However, it can be violated if the user follows a predefined pattern when selecting the five points in an image as their passwords, such as the DIAG and LINE patterns. Dictionary attacks can be built using these two patterns to compromise graphical passwords. So far, no reports have been found in the state of the art about any test capable of detecting graphical passwords with DIAG or LINE patterns in PassPoints. Studies carried out in other scenarios have shown the effectiveness of the characteristics of Delaunay triangulations in extracting information about the dependence between the points. In this work, graphical passwords formed by five randomly selected points on an image are compared with passwords whose points contain patterns of the DIAG or LINE type. The comparison is based on building for each password its Delaunay triangulation and calculating the mean value of the maximum angles of the triangles obtained; such a mean value is denoted by amadt. It is experimentally shown that in passwords containing DIAG and LINE patterns, the value of amadt is higher than the one obtained in passwords formed by random dots. From this result, it is proposed to use this amadt value as a statistic to build a test of means. This result constitutes the work’s main contribution: The proposal of a spatial randomness test to detect weak graphic passwords that contain DIAG and LINE type patterns. The importance and novelty of this result become evident when two aspects are taken into account: First, these weak passwords can be exploited by attackers to improve the effectiveness of their attacks; second, there are no prior criteria to detect this type of weak password. The practical application of said test contributes to increasing PassPoints security without substantially affecting its efficiency.},
